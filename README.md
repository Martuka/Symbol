# Symbol

Symbol is a VR application for Google card board. Inspired by the cult movie of the same name by the Japanese artist Hitoshi Matsumoto, Symbol is an experience of an exhibition space where one can contemplate works of art as well as the aesthetic changes that the light operates over them.

Symbol is developed with Unity 5.5 and uses the packages [gvr-unity-sdk](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/) and [overview](https://developers.google.com/vr/cardboard/overview)
